# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

> Exploratory data analysis and modeling.

## Project Description

Customer churn happens when customers stop using a company's services or cancel their subscriptions. This impacts the company's income, growth, and customer loyalty. By understanding why customers leave, businesses can find ways to keep them happy, reduce churn, and improve retention. They can also use tools to predict when customers might leave and take steps to keep them from doing so.

This project represent the exploration of the dataset and prediction of whether a customer will churn or not churn.
